## ü§ç T.Hanks

From the *Forest Gump*, to *The Man Called Otto*, Tom Hanks always surprised me
by how he act in a movie. Similarly, to you. You have always been surprising me
from the beginning I met you. I actually didn't notice there is one person whom
being so into me for anything but jokes and stuff.

Well...

As we walk past the days of suffering and yet sacrificing, you're the only
person who trust me the most, who've always guide me into the better place,
better thinking, and better strategy. Strange huh? We met because we loved doing
outdoor activities such as a big-BIG festival or concerts (not to mention
orchestra because that would be so boring without all the jumps).

Mentioning all the "jumps" and "falls" that we did before the sun sets
everyday it scraps my brain and made my heart explode like a falling star, as
you can see day-to-day.

## ü§ç Picture-in-Picture

Well I keep to do stuff and you also **DO** stuff. I couldn't pretend to doing
nothing to made you off the list, I pin all the stuff, respond first with
almighty speed to your liking. As if you're my first priority (well you are).

Enough reading, I know you don't like long ass paragraphs.

I can't hold it much longer, as if all the love in me burst into happiness and
bloom the gloomy weekends of my live.

You never read my blog, because I rarely updates it, but...

Will you make me the most happiest man in the world? I try my best to make you
the most happiest woman ever existed in life and everafter.

Thanks for being with me all this long and accepts me who I was and who I am,
right now.

You're my best present in 2023.

Love you, nggi. ‚ù§Ô∏è
