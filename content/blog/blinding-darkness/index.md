## üèπ Abomination

I saw the path surrounded by an enormous trees. This dark jungle is not scary at
all, but well because I am old enough and experienced enough to pass this way
lets go proceed to the next part.

As I walk slowly through the forest, 3 green lights appeared in front of me.
Should I choose one of them ? Or just go by ? Well, I chosen the left one since
I need to go to the first part of this test.

Suddenly, I teleported to nowhere...

This is above the sky that I was currently standing on and I'm not getting used
to fly this high.

I landed on a strange ground and broad field. I saw a big gloomy Troll over
there. I thought about killing him, but...

"*Welcome the young emperor who are gonna rule the world, would you mind to keep
quiet? I've been meditating here since the last Ersoe before he vanished*"  
says the Troll calmly.

I wonder why such a kind has this personal preference of talking or is this the
test ? I need to make sure if the troll is juvenile and not gonna go berserk
while I pass these land.
